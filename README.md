# Cocos2Djs
Cocos2Djs is a neat game engine for the web, desktop, and mobile phone.  It is however, ported from Cocos2D-x, and is relatively new, which results the lack of good documentation of examples.
Here is an example project I used to create my online portfolio that will show you some of the basics as well as particle effects. 

You will first need cocos2D-js installed correctly: http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Getting_Started_Cocos2d-JS.  

The code uses a simple custom MVC (Model View Controller) model to keep the code organized; its not perfect nor super strict though.  You can see it in action here: http://flashosophy.com/portfolio
